  <h2>Use Friendly and Simple</h2>
  <p>
    You can write HTML using annotations called tags. Tags give HTML a structure and make it easy for humans and browsers to read the document efficiently. They also enable a browser to apply CSS (Cascaded StyleSheets) to the digital document, making it a powerful visual combination.

  <h2> Semantic Structure  </h2>
  <p>
    HTML5 defines unique tags to annotate different elements for their specific purposes. The <article> tag, for example, is used to annotate content on a page. The <aside> tag represents some content that is indirectly related to the documentâ€™s primary content. Other noteworthy elements are <header>, <footer>, <div>, the paragraph tag <p>, and the one most used for navigation between pages, the <a> tag.
