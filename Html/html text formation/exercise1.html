    <blockquote>I bought this course because I have struggled to make my own website for my solo language coaching business for 3 years. I got stuck on the copy every single time.I sailed through the course in about 10 days because it’s sectioned into digestible modules that kept me curious to learn more. My copywriting skills have improved drastically and I’ve taken up a new interest in the world of copywriting. Thank you.</blockquote>
