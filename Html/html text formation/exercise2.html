<h2>MAKE THE BATTER</h2>
<p>
   -Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottom with parchment paper and then grease the top. Or grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans. <br>
   -Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C).Whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl until very well blended. <br>
   -In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla.
<br>
-Add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each one.
-Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl, then add the dry ingredients in three parts, gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth.
<hr>
<h2>BAKE CAKE</h2>
<p>
  -Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans. <br>
  -Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. <br>
  -Cool cakes in the pans for 15 minutes, then carefully turn the cake layers out onto cooling racks. Remove the parchment paper and cool completely. If you find that a cake layer is sticking to the bottom of the pan, leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing. <br>

<h2>TO FINISH</h2>
 
-In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with a handheld mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 1 minute. <br>
-Beat in the powdered sugar, a 1/4 cup at a time, until fluffy. <br>
 -Pour in the whipping cream. Beat on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the frosting is whipped and creamy. This frosting resembles the texture of whipped cream. Chill covered until ready to frost the cake. <br>
 -When the cake layers are completely cool, frost the top of one cake layer, and place the second cake layer on top. <br>
 -Add the remaining frosting to the top of the carrot cake and use a butter knife or small spatula to swirl the frosting around. Leave the sides of the cake unfrosted. Finish with a handful of nuts on top.
